I thought I would write a little about it here on my blog.
I recently did a little work to flesh out the plugin interface for Myriad. My friend Enrico Sada helped out with some of the fiddly MsBuild work in dotnet which can be a little confusing at times.
The gist of the plugin is that you must implement the following interface:</description></item><item><title>Applied Meta-Programming</title><link>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/2019-04-24-applied-metaprogramming-with-myriad/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/2019-04-24-applied-metaprogramming-with-myriad/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-myriad">What is Myriad?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/7sharp9/myriad">Myriad&lt;/a> is a pre-compilation tool that generates code from code. It is integrated into the project build cycle via an MSBuild extension. It is also possible to invoke the tool separately as a &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x">CLI tool&lt;/a> but this essay will deal with describing the integration within an MSBuild project as this would be the most common pattern of usage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I want to tell you a storyboard</title><link>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/2017-04-11-i-want-to-tell-you-a-storyboard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 23:11:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/2017-04-11-i-want-to-tell-you-a-storyboard/</guid><description>&lt;p>So as promised here&amp;rsquo;s a post with more detail on the iOS designer provider that I presented as part of my talk at &lt;a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8053-f-sharp-exchange-2017">fsharpX 2017&lt;/a> The talk is entitled &lt;a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10042-lightning-talk-session-expanding-the-horizons-of-mobile-development">Expanding the Horizons of Mobile Development&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meta-Matic</title><link>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/meta-matic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/meta-matic/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sit down, strap in, and prepare for take off, we&amp;rsquo;re going Meta-Matic!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I saw my reflection and cried ...</title><link>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/2014-11-17-i-saw-my-reflection-and-cried-dot-dot-dot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/2014-11-17-i-saw-my-reflection-and-cried-dot-dot-dot/</guid><description>While I was visiting Boston earlier in the year I had the misfortune of kicking myself in the teeth with reflection. It&amp;rsquo;s something all programmers inevitably go through with reflection API&amp;rsquo;s as they are inherently untyped, a simple typo can leave you tearing out your hair or punching through your monitor! Yeah there&amp;rsquo;s things the horizon that will help namely the nameof expression in C#6 which should help in some areas, that&amp;rsquo;s if your willing to pay the price of using C#, but I wont go into that here :-).</description></item><item><title>Flux Compression (redux)</title><link>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/2014-11-05-flux-compression-redux/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/2014-11-05-flux-compression-redux/</guid><description>First of all the title, redux because I&amp;rsquo;m revising post I started on earlier in the year, compression because this has to do with compression, and Flux, which is also part of the redux, one of the first things I remember writing on the net was an article about Flux Compression Generators on H2G2, its still there too!
This was a post I started writing back in January that I never got round to finishing.</description></item></channel></rss>
