Ive been meaning to write this post for ages but Ive only just found the time.  

On the 3rd of September my good friend Ryan Riley (aka [@panesofglass][1]) emailed me letting me know I had won a Community for F# hero award for 2015!    
<!--more-->  
I want to say a big thank you to everyone who voted for me.  Its really nice to be recognized for the things that you do. 

Anyway, this is just a quick post to say thanks, and share a cup of coffee :-)
