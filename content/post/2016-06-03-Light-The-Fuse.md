In this post Im going to be introducing something new and exciting the combination of F#, Fable and Fuse.  If I was American I might say this was the holy trinity of awesomeness!<!--more-->

This is the start of an exciting new series on using F# as a transpiling language to "light the Fuse" (pun intended) on new platform and opportunities for F#.  

OK, so now for the introductions...

# What is Fable

Put simply Fable is a transpiler for F# that turn F# into JavaScript.  Lets face it JavaScript is really pervasive but not everyone wants to write it.  You can read about how Fable works [here][2]

# What is fuse?

Taken from their site this is what fuse is in a nutshell: 

## FUSE IS FOR MOBILE APP DESIGNERS AND DEVELOPERS

Create and update the look and feel for native apps in real time
on multiple devices simultaneously. 

Fuse is a set of tools (currently in beta) that makes design and developing native mobile apps for iOS and Android fast, easy and fun. Fuse is free, and weâ€™re actively working towards making it Open Source as well.

Fuse introduces UX Markup - a XML-based language for creating truly native, data-driven, responsive, smoothly animated and highly interactive experiences, while sharing most of the code between iOS and Android. UX is easy to learn and incredibly powerful.

Fuse is fast. Based on Uno, a language which compiles down to pure C++ code, and seamlessly interops with Objective-C (iOS) and Java (Android) where needed. The UI is rendered using native platform controls, OpenGL or a combination (best of both worlds).

For business logic, Fuse runs JavaScript on a separate thread on both iOS and Android, so your UI is fast and responsive no matter what it is doing. Fuse lets you call seamlessly into C++, Java and Objective-C libraries through Uno when you need it.  

You can read about Fuse in more depth on their site [here][1], you really should take a look.

# Introducing **Fable |> Fuse**

Fable-Fuse is a set of packages that allows you use power of F# with [Fuse][1].  

First of all lets have a little look at some declarative UI with Fuse.

This is taken from the original Fuse Sample titled ***Parsing JSON fetched over HTTP***   which is located [here][3]

```
<App Theme="Basic" Background="#eee">
    <DockPanel>
        <StatusBarBackground Dock="Top" />
        <BottomBarBackground Dock="Bottom" />
        <ScrollView>
            <Grid ColumnCount="2">
                <JavaScript>
                    var Observable = require("FuseJS/Observable");

                    var data = Observable();

                    fetch('http://az664292.vo.msecnd.net/files/ZjPdBhWNdPRMI4qK-colors.json')
                        .then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
                        .then(function(responseObject) { data.value = responseObject; });

                    module.exports = {
                        data: data
                    };
                </JavaScript>
                <Each Items="{data.colorsArray}">
                    <DockPanel Height="120" Margin="10,0">
                        <Panel DockPanel.Dock="Top" Margin="10" Height="30">
                            <Rectangle Layer="Background" CornerRadius="10" Fill="#fff"/>
                            <Text Value="{colorName}" TextAlignment="Center" Alignment="Center" />
                        </Panel>

                        <Rectangle Layer="Background" CornerRadius="10" Fill="{hexValue}"/>
                    </DockPanel>
                </Each>
            </Grid>
        </ScrollView>
    </DockPanel>
</App>
```

You can see the UI mark-up is concise and easy to follow, also notice the JavaScript element which can be in-line, as shown here, or placed in a separate file.  We will place this in a separate file so that we can transpile from F# using [Fable][2].

```fsharp
namespace Program
open Fable.Core
open Fuse
open Fable.Import
open Fable.Import.Fetch

module HttpJson =
    let data = Observable.create()
    promise {
        let! req = GlobalFetch.fetch (Url "http://az664292.vo.msecnd.net/files/ZjPdBhWNdPRMI4qK-colors.json")
        let! json = req.json ()
        do (data.value <- json) } |> ignore
```

You can see here there is a custom computation expression that allows you to use JavaScrip promises, you could also use a pipeline oriented definition too, like this:

```fsharp
GlobalFetch.fetch (Url "http://az664292.vo.msecnd.net/files/ZjPdBhWNdPRMI4qK-colors.json")
|> Promise.success (fun resp -> resp.json())                                                                          
|> Promise.success (fun json -> data.value <- json) 
|> ignore
```

Or if you really really wanted to you could integrate this into an F# async with a little helper type extension:
```fsharp
module AsyncExtensions =    
    type Microsoft.FSharp.Control.AsyncBuilder with
        member x.Bind(p, f) = 
            async.Bind (Async.AwaitPromise(p), f)
```

This would allow you to use a promise with an ordinary `let!`
```fsharp
async {
    let! req = GlobalFetch.fetch "http://az664292.vo.msecnd.net/files/ZjPdBhWNdPRMI4qK-colors.json"
    let! json = req.json ()
    do (data.value <- json) } |> Async.Start 
```

Anyway I digress, needless to say there are various options with promises and how to handle them with **Fable |> Fuse**.

What's more because Fuse and Fable are real-time you can edit the UX definitions and it the application in real-time across multiple devices!

## So how do I get started with **Fable |> Fuse** ?

Well you'll have to hold your horses, I was so excited to share this introductory post I haven't wrote that part yet.  The package I'm working on is still private while I finalise things and make it really easy and friendly to create applications with **Fable |> Fuse**.  

Stay tuned as there will be more in this series next week as I discuss the more technical aspects and how to create your first **Fable |> Fuse** application.  

If there is enough interest I will also live stream this on my [livecoding.tv channel][6], please subscribe.  

A really big thanks to Alfonso Garcia-Caro ([@alfonsogcnunez][5]) creator of Fable for answering all my annoying questions.  And Lars Thomas Denstad ([@cocporn][4]) for help creating the Fuse API bindings for Fable.   

Until next time!
