As from today I am detaching myself from the social networking strings of Twitter.  
<!-- more -->  

{{< figure class="2u img-left" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-leQmmqGT3gI/Uu__BpNQxrI/AAAAAAAAByQ/R-ZZFWqKhKQ/w416-h512-no/Twitter_logo_blue.png" >}} have quite a few Twitter followers now and don't want to seem ignorant, nor do I want to make a point of tweeting about my detachment etc etc.  

So here's what I'm doing.  I have removed twitter from all my devices and modified my account settings so that I receive an email if I'm mentioned or receive a direct message, so I will respond so specific queries if necessary.  

I'm freeing up my rapidly decreasing free time to spend time on other things that I want to do rather than ranting or watching a stream of mostly re-tweets, memes, food pictures, and rants.  No one really wants to know that I find C# infuriating sixteen times a day, or that I love the sound of extended power chords.

I'm especially susceptible to broadcasting whats on my mind but I will choose to do that with a medium that I can express myself in more than 140 characters, like here on my blog.  I love writing and plan on doing more as I find it cathartic.  

I'm still available on Skype - `sevensharp9`, and Gtalk etc, just check out the [contact me][1] page for email details.  Or even just leave a comment here!

Until next time!
