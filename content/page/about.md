Hi, my name is Dave Thomas and Im a software engineer from the Uk.  I work primarily in F# but also like to tinker with pretty much any interesting language.  Im drawn to more functional languages like F#, Elm, but also like to use Rust, and recently Clojure.  

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/7sharp9_exhumed).

Thanks for reading!
