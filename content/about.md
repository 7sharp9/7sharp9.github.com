Hi, my name is Dave Thomas and Im a software engineer from the Uk.  I work primarily in F# but also like to tinker with pretty much any interesting language.  Im drawn to more functional languages like F#, Elixir, Elm, but also like to use Go, Rust, and recently Pony.  

When Im not working I like: playing guitar, woodworking, watercolour sketching, and also practice yoga.
