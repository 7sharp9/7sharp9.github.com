I&rsquo;ve been doing a spot of compiler hacking, working on improving type Providers and generally tinkering with concepts relating to macros etc. I&rsquo;ve also been tinkering with the Elixir and Rust programming languages which I like a lot. I might write about those things at a later time depending on my train of thought which can be quite disjoint. What was I talking about again? :-)</p><p>So, emulators, that&rsquo;s what I was going to talk about. Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about emulators, reading about them, and also watching streams about writing them. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in emulators but never sat down and looked at the theory or written one. So I&rsquo;ve started live streaming creating one on <a href=https://www.livecoding.tv/livestreams/>LiveCoding.tv</a> which is apparently where you go to:</p><blockquote><p>Watch coders code products live and hang out with them</p></blockquote><p>So I&rsquo;ve started live coding an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST>Atari ST</a> emulator with its <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000>68000 CPU</a> using LiveCoding.tv. I&rsquo;ve chosen an Atari St because it was one of the computers that I grew up with and the computer I first started to program on. I have many many fond memories of it. I may also stream about building other types of emulators not just the 68000. There are plenty of interesting hardware systems and processor types that I grew up with. I was thinking of building an arcade emulator such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_System>Capcom Play System</a> but the technical data is a bit more difficult to get hold of.</p><p>In some respects emulator coding is quite tricky, a lot of research and digging is required to get the relevant information you need, and a lot of grunt work inputting data can also be involved too. In short its not a trivial task, at least it isn&rsquo;t if you want to do one properly. I cant promise it will be super interesting, or even done properly, but it will be raw coding warts and all :-)</p><p>You can find my channel here <a href=https://www.livecoding.tv/7sharp9/>Building Emulators with F#</a> I normally stream a couple of days a week, currently Wednesday and Friday 17:00 GMT but I also may also stream at other times too.</p><p>Until next time &mldr;</p></div></section><section class="pagination clearfix"><a class="btn previous" href=https://7sharp9.dev/fsharp/2015-10-25-f-community-hero/>F# Community Hero</a>
